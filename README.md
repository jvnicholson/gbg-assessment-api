WebApi Assessment for GBG Job Application. This is the API for the client web app found [here](https://github.com/jvnicholson/gbg-assessment-web). This is the source code. A running version of the API is temporarily being hosted in Azure so that installing and running the client web app will work smoothly without the need to locally build and deploy this WebAPI app.
