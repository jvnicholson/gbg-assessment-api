# gbg-assessment-api

WebApi Assessment for GBG Job Application. This is the API for the client web app found [here](https://github.com/jvnicholson/gbg-assessment-web). 

A running version of the API is temporarily being hosted in Azure so that installing and running the [client web app](https://github.com/jvnicholson/gbg-assessment-web) will work smoothly without the need to locally build and deploy this WebAPI app.
